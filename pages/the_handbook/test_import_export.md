Instructors can build their own test questions and assign specific point values to each question. When a student completes a test, it is submitted for grading and the results are recorded in the Grades area. Tests can be added to the Quizzes area within a course and can also appear in Assignments and in Modules. Instructors can export tests from their current or previous courses and import tests into a new course.

If you would like assistance with this process or would like to bulk create questions for import please contact the Academic Technology Team.

**Note**: This exports the test questions but not the answers or results. It exports as a QTI file in a .zip package.

## Back-up Your Tests

It is good practice to back-up your Tests at the end of your course. As described above you can easily export your test/exam from Quercus as a QTI file and store it on your computer and/or back-up storage device. It is *strongly* recommended that you do this at the end of every term as this will reduce the number of duplicate tests carried from course copy to course copy year over year.
