Each of your courses in Quercus has a course lifecycle that begins once the course is created and made available. There are certain events that are triggered automatically by the University's central administrators and there are some suggested tasks that you, as a faculty member, are responsible to complete. These suggested tasks will make preserving your course content easier from course to course and year to year and also highlights some of the things that need to happen to make your course available to your students.
