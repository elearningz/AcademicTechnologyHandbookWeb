The Grades area is a repository of student grades for your course. You can also mark papers, with feedback, and release or hide grades from the students.

To access the Grades area, go to your course and click on the Grades area in the lefthand navigation.

The Grades area has a listing of your enrolled students with their names and UTORids along with their grades you have entered into Quercus. Students, Instructors, and TAs all access the Grades area from the same place in the course but the view is tailored for the role. What this means is that students, of course, are not able to view any grades but their own nor do they have a spreadsheet type overview of the grades.

## Download Grades

You can download your gradebook as a CSV file for archiving and record keeping or also to mark and re-upload.

To download the gradebook as a CSV file go to the Grades area and from the default Gradebook view click the Export button in the upper right portion of the screen. This will give you the option to download a CSV of the gradebook.

## Hide Grades from Student / Release Grades to Students

It is generally recommended to hide feedback from students while you are completing your marking so you can release everyone's feedback and marks at the same time. To do this in Quercus you will need to hover over the Column Title for the assignment you want to hide and click the chevron that appears.

There will be a dropdown menu which will allow you to select the option Mute Assignment.

To release feedback and grades you can follow the same steps but now click Unmute Assignment.

If an assignment is muted it will have an icon of a bell with a slash through it {% include inline_image.html file="Grades/muted.png"  alt="muted assignment icon from Quercus" %} beside the title.

**Note**: If you are using Turnitin with your assignments and you would like your students to see their Turnitin report immediately upon submission you will have to leave the assignment unmuted during the submission process. When you are ready to mark you can mute the assignment at this point.

## Create a Column

The only way to make a column in the gradebook is to create a new assignment in your course. When the assignment is created in the assignments area of your course it will automatically generate a column in the Grades area.

## Online Exams/Tests

If you are using online exams or tests in your course grades will be calculated automatically for any question type that cab be automatically marked (ie. Multiple choice, True False, etc.). However, it is recommended that you mute the column prior to the exam or test so you can double check the exams before releasing the grades.
