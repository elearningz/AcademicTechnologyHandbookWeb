The Grades area is a repository of student grades for your course. You can also mark papers, with feedback, and release or hide grades from the students.

To access the Grades area, go to your course and click on the Grades area in the lefthand navigation.

The Grades area has a listing of your enrolled students with their names and UTORids along with their grades you have entered into Quercus. Students, Instructors, and TAs all access the Grades area from the same place in the course but the view is tailored for the role. What this means is that students, of course, are not able to view any grades but their own nor do they have a spreadsheet type overview of the grades.
