Students and instructors are added to courses automatically by central registration systems. However, as an instructor you are responsible for adding TAs and other staff to your course.

## Add a TA or other Course Staff:

Adding course staff to a course is the same process as adding a Teaching Assistant.

   1. Go to the People area of your course and click the + People button.

   2. Choose to either use their U of T email or their Login ID (UtorID) by clicking the radio button next to the option you want.

   3. In the Text Box add their email or UTORID and select the role from the dropdown menu.

   4. Click the Next button.

   5. A popup will appear to confirm and you can click Add Users.

   6. The added individual will receive an invite to join the course and show as pending in your list until they login to Quercus and accept the invite.

## Course Roles in Quercus

There are a number of different roles available to you when adding someone to your course. To better understand the roles here is a breakdown for what they can do please see the following resource created by Quercus support: [Course Roles and Permissions](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/course-roles-and-permissions)

### An Important Note on the Student Role

One role option available is **Student**. As a general rule we don't recommend adding anyone as a student and below are some important considerations when using this role to manually add someone to your course:

   - **Students must enroll in courses through ACORN (the official student record system) in order to receive academic credit.** Students enrolled in your course through ACORN will appear on your class list in Quercus automatically. This tool must not be used to manually add students who have registered, or will be registering, in your course through ACORN.  Student information in Quercus is updated every business day.
   - **This tool can be used to add individuals who are not officially enrolled in the course through ACORN (e.g. auditors, students writing deferred exams)**. Students must understand that being manually enrolled in Quercus is not equivalent to being officially enrolled in the course and a different role as detailed in the resource above may be more appropriate.
