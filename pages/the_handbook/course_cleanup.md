There are a number of different types of content that can be added to Quercus The university has put together some good information and informative videos regarding basic Course Content and the best ways to add them to your course. Please go to [Quercus Support Resources](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670) and the [Modules and Pages](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/modules-and-pages) area for more in-depth information.

What this section focuses on is what you can do to your content to prepare it for copying and re-use after it has been added.

After the term is done and your course is complete it is suggested that you go through the content of your course and remove any extraneous files, pages, and modules you will not be re-using. It is advised that you also delete any unneeded announcements, discussion forums, tests, and assignments. This is particularly important if you would like to copy your course from one semester to the next and ensure that unnecessary files and content are not copied over to your new course.

Not performing a course cleanup will eventually cause issues with the course storage quota (3000 MB by default) and your ability to organize your course content. Try to only save content you are going to re-use. If you want to have a backup of everything from an old course make an export of the course before you delete any content. Archiving your course is covered elsewhere in this handbook.

## Cleanup (Remove) Content

To look at the files that are stored in the Files area, go to the **Files** area of your course by selecting it in the lefthand navigation menu. Please go through this content carefully and remove any unnecessary or redundant content.
