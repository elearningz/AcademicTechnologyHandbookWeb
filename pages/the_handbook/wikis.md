Wiki pages allow course members to contribute and modify one or more pages of course-related materials and provide a means of sharing and collaboration. Users can edit pages which allows for effective collaboration between multiple writers.

In essence every page in your Quercus course can be created as a Wiki page. When you make a new page and you would like it to be a wiki page you can change the default setting for the page to make it editable by Teachers and Students rather than Teachers only. In this way students will be able to contribute to the page.

You can view the page history to see all the edits and additions made to the page.

**Note**: Quercus pages currently only support asynchronous editing. If multiple users need to edit a Wiki page at the same time, they may encounter issues. For this reason we recommend writing or making changes in a word processor and then pasting onto the page so you don't lose data in the event something goes wrong.

For further information about Pages please see the [Pages](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10460#jive_content_id_Pages) area in the Canvas Guides.
