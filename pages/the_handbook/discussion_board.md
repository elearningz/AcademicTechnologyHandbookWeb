Your course on Quercus has a space where you can host online discussions. The discussions are asynchronous meaning that they can be effective places to have discussions over a period of time. They can be maintained as an archive for review throughout the course. Much like modules they can also be set to become available based on time and date parameters.

## Discussion Board Basics

The Discussions can be created and found in the Discussions area of your course.

They are structured as Topics (created at the top level) and replies (which happen inside the topics).

Discussions are searchable and can be ungraded or graded depending how you want to assess the activity. 

To read more about the Discussions area of the course please see the [Discussions](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10460#jive_content_id_Discussions) area in the Canvas Guide.
