You can create tests and surveys directly in your Quercus course which can be graded by the system (in the case of multiple choice tests) or display and export the survey results from within Quercus.

Creating online tests and gathering survey feedback can be useful even in a course that is not online to create practice quizzes and other formative assessments or surveys to gather feedback about your course to help inform course changes and teaching strategy.
