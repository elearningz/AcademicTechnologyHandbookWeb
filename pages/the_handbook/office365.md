As of December 2017 the majority of faculty and all students have access to Office365 via the University of Toronto webmail. You can login to your Office365 account by going to [mail.utoronto.ca](http://mail.utoronto.ca) in a web browser. The Office365 tools available can be used for teaching and learning in your courses.

The three main components that are most relevant for teaching and learning are OneDrive, Skype for Business, and the browser-based Office Suite. In addition there may be a future integration with the Learning Management Engine (LME), Canvas, at some point in the future so this document touches briefly on that.

## Onedrive

OneDrive is a cloud-based file storage and file sharing service. You can upload documents and media files to your one drive or create them using the browser-based office suite. Once stored in your OneDrive you are then able to share these items with others through the use of links. These links have fine-grained permissions so you can target exactly which people should have access.

### Accessing your OneDrive

To access your OneDrive login to your webmail at [mail.utoronto.ca](http://mail.utoronto.ca) and click the grid of squares in the upper left corner.

Clicking on the OneDrive icon will take you to the OneDrive area of your Office365 account.


### Creating, Uploading, and Sharing files with OneDrive

You can place files in OneDrive in two ways. The first is by creating the file using the online Office Suite (Word, Powerpoint, Excel) and the second is by uploading a file.

You have a generous amount of storage space in your OneDrive (approx. 1 TB) so it can be an effective way to share files that might be clogging up your storage quota in your Blackboard/Canvas courses.

To create a file in OneDrive using the online Office Suite click the 'New' button at the top of your OneDrive and select the type of file you would like to create.

You can also create Folders in this way and the sharing permissions can be applied at a folder level as well, which makes organizing and groups of items more straightforward.

To upload a file in OneDrive click on the 'Upload' button located beside the 'New' button and select a file from your computer. You can upload most file types but note the size as large files may take awhile to upload, especially if you are on a home internet connection.

To share a file you can select the file/folder you'd like to share and click the share button which has an icon of an arrow emerging from a rectangle.

The easiest way to share a file is to create a link. There are 3 tiers of permissions when creating a link.

1. Anyone can access.
2. University of Toronto users can access.
3. Specific People (by email address) can access.

Once you click the share button you'll see a box that allows you to set the options. Click the area that says "Only the people you specify will have access to edit" which will take you to the 'Link Settings' menu.

If it is for a course, in most cases you'd select either Anyone or People in University of Toronto. Remember, if you don't want people to be able to edit make sure to deselect the 'Allow Editing' option.

Once you have set the permissions click the 'Apply' button and then the 'Copy Link' button. You can paste this link in your course or send it via email.

## Skype for Business

Skype for Business is an online communication tool. It can be used to have voice and video meetings, exchange instant messages, share your screen, and broadcast yourself to a group in a webinar format. The Skype for Business platform is a distinct service and separate from your already existing Skype Account (if you have one).

### Scheduling a Skype Session

You can schedule a Skype Session by adding one to an Event in your Calendar using your webmail. To access the calendar click on the Calendar icon in the lower left of your webmail screen.

One in the Calendar when you are scheduling a new event click the 'Add Skype Meeting' option. This will create a Skype Meeting link in your event that will be emailed out to those you have included as invitees to the event. On the day of the event everyone can join the Skype session using the Skype for Business web app or Desktop app by clicking on the link in the meeting invite.

## Office Suite (Word, Powerpoint, etc.)

The browser-based online version of Office Suite are nearly identical to the existing Office applications most are familiar with except that you are able to edit and create documents directly from your web browser. The online office suite includes Word, Powerpoint, and Excel.

### Accessing the Word, Powerpoint, and Excel Online

To access Word, Powerpoint, or Excel Online click on the grid of squares in the upper right of your webmail view. Then click the icon for the specific app you'd like to open.

{% include image.html file="Office365/waffle-open.png" alt="waffle menu for accessing Office365 apps" caption="Accessing Apps Through 'Waffle' Menu" %}

The online version of these Microsoft apps work very similar to the desktop versions with the noted exception that they save automatically to your OneDrive as you work. You can share and present documents from directly within the app which makes accessing them from any computer very straightforward.

## Class Notebooks

Class Notebooks are a feature that has not yet been integrated into the LME but when it is you will be able to use it to create handouts and collaborative assignments to share with your class.
