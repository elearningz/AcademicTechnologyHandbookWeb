To backup your course you can create a Course Export that can then be loaded into another course or course sandbox to view it later.

*__It is your responsibility to backup your course at the end of semester__*. We recommend keeping a copy of the export on your computer as well as on a USB drive so it is redundantly stored in case of data loss. If you are collecting assignments and managing grades in Quercus you should also download the Grades and any Assignments you want a record of for your course.
