ProctorU is an online proctoring system to monitor your students duiring their online exams for academic integrity purposes.

As an instructor you do not need an account on Proctor U.

The students are proctored by Proctor U and the Academic Technology team provides support during the exam. The exams are taken on the Blackboard portal.

Documentation and support are provided by the Academic Technology Team and will be sent out prior to the proctored exams to guide students through the signup and exam taking process.

## Signing up and Testing your Computer

When students are told it is available (by the Academic Technology team), they must register on the Proctor U Site - [proctoru.com/utoronto-nursing](http://proctoru.com/portal/utoronto-nursing) and then book their exam time on the appropriate day and time.

On the day of the exam, they log in through the same site and write the exam.


If students have had technical issues in the past or are concerned about using Proctor U they can schedule a time to talk to Proctor U's technical support team. The support team is able to test the students connectivity and verify that their computer will be ready come exam day. Students can contact the support team by visiting [http://www.proctoru.com/testitout](http://www.proctoru.com/testitout), filling out the form and clicking the button that says "Connect to a Live Person".

Students should make sure their internet is fast and reliable. If students are connecting via wireless, they should test their speed at at [speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/) and ideally they will have a Download and Upload Speed of at least 1.5 Mbps. If your students are at all concerned about technical issues they should connect to a Live Person at Proctor U as detailed above.

Please note: The exam time does not start until the student enters the exam in Blackboard. The time it takes to setup with the proctor will not affect the students test time. Any technical difficulties should be reported so they will also not affect the students' test time.

## Writing the Exam

At the date and time of the test, students log into Proctor U with the username and password that they created when they scheduled their test. A message will appear saying, “It’s go time! Click here to start your exam”. Students click on this link to go to the proctoring room and start their exam.

Communication regarding Proctor U will be handled by the Academic Technology team. The team will also act as go-betweens for students writing the exam and Proctor U should any technical difficulties arrive.

Messaging about this process is available if you'd like to see it and will be sent out to students prior to their exam scheduling and writing.
