summary: This page details the structure of some of the online Nurse Practitioner courses, such as the Pathophysiology course and the Health Assessment course, to provide some background rationale and methodology for using the templates that are copied into the course prior to every term.

This page describes the process and structure for some of the online Nurse Practitioner Program's courses in terms of course setup and course management given that they have relative large and complex structures that are mostly shared between sections.

## Template Copy and Course Sandboxes

Prior to the term instructors are typically given access to or request access to a shared course sandbox from which everyone can contribute to organizing and posting new material for the upcoming term to create a "course template" of sorts. Because these are shared sandboxes what happens is that a baseline is created so each section can begin with an equivalent setup to better support the online students giving them a consistent experience across sections and courses.

When setup of the sandbox course is completed a request is made to the Academic Technology Team to copy the sandbox course into each of the current "live" course sections.

For example, a *NUR1091 Sandbox (jointly setup by the NUR1091/92/93 instructors)* will be copied to *NUR1091 6331 and NUR1091 6332*.

At  this point both sections will now have an equivalent baseline of structure and content.

After the sandbox is copied across on a request basis we can add each instructor to the other sections of the course so that throughout the term sharing content is much easier. There are usually many shared webinars and presentations, which make this very beneficial.

## Course Structure

The online NP courses typically follow a structure that works like this with the Weekly Modules appearing after Course Information following teh same structure until the end of the course:

**COURSE**

**MODULES**

**Course Information Module**
- Lists of Pages and Resources for Common Course Information and Admin Details

**Week # Introduction, Objectives and Supplementary Resources Module** (Opens Friday 9am before Module start)
- Introduction and Objectives Page
  - Page Contains Learning Objectives and Introduction to the week
- Supplementary Resources Page
  - Page contains Supplementary Resources links to readings, files, etc.

**Week # Required Learning Activities Module** (Opens Monday 9am of Module start)
- Required Learning Activities Page
  - Page contains all the Required Learning Activities and Resources for the module
    - Typically an Introduction (podcast or otherwise);
    - List and/or links of required readings;
    - Link to the lecture/guest lecture material and slides;
    - Link to the webinar and/or recording of the lecture;
    - Link to the Scholarly Posts Module;
    - Link to the Clinical Discussion for the Module;
    - Link to the Summary and Practice Quiz for the Module;
    - etc.


**Week # Scholarly Posts** (Opens Monday 9am of Module start)
- Scholarly Post Page 1
- Scholarly Post Page 2
- Scholarly Post Page 3
- ...
- and so on

*Scholarly Posts Pages are editable by students and instructors and are where students complete the weekly scholarly post requirement as laid out in teh Required Learning Activities page*

Other areas of the course that should be accessible to students aside from Modules arenfound in the lefthand navigation and include:

- Announcements
- Syllabus
- Assignments
- Discussions
- Grades
- BB Collaborate
- Quizzes

## Things to Consider

Given the structure and the typical scenario of collaborating within each other's courses there are some common questions and issues to think about when working within these courses.

### Double check your assignments area and assignments

The assignments for the course should be setup in the sandbox prior to the term so you should not have to create assignments. However, you should double check to make sure the assignment information is correct and things like the due date, Turnitin (if using), and any support material are setup.

### Be *VERY* careful copying and pasting from one course to another

Oftentimes it will make sense if you want to share content across sections to try and copy and paste. This is fine in instances where there are no links to files. If the page you are copying contains a link to a file students will receive errors when they try to access this file in the other section.

The reason this happens is that when you copy and paste it creates a link to the file in the other course it does not make a copy of that file.

As a result if you would like to copy and paste content we advise you re-link/re-upload all files in the new section once you've completed the copy and paste.

If the entire page is going to be identical across all sections and you're not just copying one part of a page an even better solution is to import that page into each section and re-add it to the module. For more information on doing this please contact the Academic Technology Team.

### Remember to share your webinars and guest lectures links across all sections

When you create a Webinar and also the associated recording using BB Collaborate in your course section you have to make sure to share with or post the Guest Link and Recording Link to the other sections that need access otherwise they will not have access.

We recommend posting these links in the pertinent spot of the Required Learning Activities Page associated with that webinar.

### If unsure about something contact the Academic Technology Team

If something doesn't seem to be working correctly or you are unsure of how to do something please reach out to Allison Lee [ali.lee@utoronto.ca](mailto:ali.lee@utoronto.ca) or Neal MacInnes [neal.macinnes@utoronto.ca](mailto:neal.macinnes@utoronto.ca) as soon as you can.

We've been supporting these courses for a number of years now and probably have a quick answer or will be able to coordinate a fix or soution between sections.

### Submit exam questions as early as possible

When it is nearing the end of term please submit exam questions for the online exams as early as possible. The Academic Technology Team will provide you with a template for building questions and can import the exams on your behalf.
