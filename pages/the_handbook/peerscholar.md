peerScholar is a peer assessment tool. Developed by Professor, Steve Joordens and Ph. D. Student Dwayne Pare at the University of Toronto Scarborough, the tool is designed to allow students to think critically and creatively, to be analytic, and to communicate their thoughts clearly through peer assessment. peerScholar is available for use in your courses.

peerScholar can be a good way to engage students in scaffolded assignments allowing them multiple opportunities for feedback from peers before submitting a larger final work to you.

**peerScholar cannot be used with Internet Explorer** so please use Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari browsers instead.
