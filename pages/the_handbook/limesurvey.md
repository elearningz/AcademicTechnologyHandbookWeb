The Faculty of Nursing now has a survey tool with more functionality than the built-in blackboard survey functionality included with your courses. If you are interested in accessing this tool you will first need to request an account.

You can use this tool to create anonymous surveys, and have access to advanced features such as survey logic and branching.

An example use of this tool could be gathering mid-term feedback from students.
