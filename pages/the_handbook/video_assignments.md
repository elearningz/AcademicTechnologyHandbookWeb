U of T has a streaming media service call MyMedia. U of T makes the MyMedia service available to all students, which allows for the uploading of videos and creating a link that can be shared. This means that the link can be submitted to your assignment dropbox text area or emailed.

This article assumes you have already recorded your video and now just need to upload and submit it to your class. For tips on recording and preparing your video please see [PDF GUIDE TITLE](#).

To generate a link you can use for an assignment submission please follow the steps outlined in this article.

## Submitting a Video Assignment

### Step 1: Create a MyMedia Account

Create a MyMedia account (if you have not created one already) by signing in with your UTORID at [mymedia.library.utoronto.ca](http://mymedia.library.utoronto.ca) and entering the information asked for (Name, Email Address, etc.).

If you already have a MyMedia account it will log you into the service, bypassing the need to enter Name and Email information. Once you are logged into the service you will be able to upload videos and manage existing videos in your account.

As a student you are able to upload as many as 30 videos. If your each your limit please delete any videos you no longer need.

### Step 2: Uploading Your Video to MyMedia

When you are logged into MyMedia you will see an _Upload Media_ button at the top-right of the page. Clicking this button will take you to a new screen that will enable you to select files for upload.

Click _Add Files_ and select your video from the computer. It will appear in the list and then the _Start Upload_ button will be available. Click _Start Upload_ to begin uploading the video.

Once your upload reaches 100% completion in the status column you can leave the page.

### Step 3: Submitting Your Video Assignment

After you have uploaded your video you will receive an email from MyMedia when it has been processed and is ready for sharing (This may take a few hours so please plan ahead).

Clicking on the link in the email will bring you to MyMedia where you can add a Title, Description, and Access Options.

There is also a _Download Options_ area. Please click the checkbox to allow downloads (this is in case there are issues streaming).
