Turnitin is an academic integrity technology for teachers and students. It offers online plagiarism detection, a grammar check and grading tools.

This tool helps students develop their writing skills while fostering academic integrity. With the integration of Turnitin within Quercus, instructors and students can now use the tool without leaving their Quercus course.

For more information about using Turnitin with your assignments please see the resource [Integration: Turnitin](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/integration-turnitin) which details how to setup Turnitin when creating an assignment.
