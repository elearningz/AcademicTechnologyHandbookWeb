If you use BB Collaborate to deliver webinars, your course files will be removed from Blackboard after 1 year (for single semester courses - F,W,S - classified courses) or 9 months (for multi-semester - Y - classified courses).

It is your responsibility to back-up and archive your BB Collaborate Recordings / Webinars.

## Backing Up Your BB Collaborate / Webinar Recordings

   1.	When creating your BB Collaborate Webinar please make sure to "Allow Recording Downloads" if you do not allow recording downloads you'll have to use an another screen capture tool to archive the webinar.
   2. Log into your course and go to your BB collaborate area.
   3.	Find your webinar under the Recordings area by clicking on the three bar menu icon {% include inline_image.html file="Collaborate_Lifecycle/BBCollabmenu.png"  alt="BB Collaborate Menu Button" %} in the upper left and then clicking on the Recordings link.
   4. Click the three dots {% include inline_image.html file="Collaborate_Lifecycle/3dots.png"  alt="BB Collaborate Menu Button" %} to the far right of the title of your webinar and then click the Download option.
   5. When you file has been downloaded store it in a secure place for re-use.
